- Ubuntu 16.04
- ROS Melodic
- Launch the system by running "cd ~/insert_path_here/IMML_Contactile_Gripper && ./launch.py"

## Tips
- add alias launchgripper="cd ~/insert_path_here/IMML_Contactile_Gripper && ./launch.py" to your .bashrc file to start the system quickly. 
- add alias killros="rosnode kill -a" to your .bashrc file to quickly kill all ros nodes if the system becomes unresponsive.
